        <p class="cards4">turn‑based mode where four players compete simultaneously to be the last one standing. Instead of building a deck and fighting in real time, you manage Elixir, pick troops from a shared pool, deploy them in rounds and can merge identical units into stronger versions. Each match is divided into a Deploy Phase (you choose and arrange your troops) and a Battle Phase (the troops auto‑fight). You also choose a "Ruler" who holds your HP—if it drops to zero, you're out.</p>
