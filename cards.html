        <p class="cards2">In Clash Royale, every battle is a strategic dance of timing and tactics, where each card represents a unique troop, spell, or building with its own strengths and weaknesses. From the relentless charge of the Hog Rider to the devastating splash damage of the Baby Dragon, players must carefully build their decks to counter opponents and control the battlefield. Legendary cards like the Electro Wizard or Mega Knight can turn the tide of a match, while cheap units like Skeletons or Bats offer quick defense and cycle potential. Victory depends not just on card levels, but on mastering synergies, predicting plays, and knowing when to strike.</p>

        <p class="card3">Cards are given them upgraded versions called "Evolved" cards. These Evolved cards have unique abilities or enhanced stats that make them stronger and more strategic in battle. To use Evolution, players need to unlock the card's evolved form and meet specific conditions during matches, such as cycling the card a certain number of times. This feature adds a new layer of depth and variety to gameplay, allowing players to customize their decks and adapt new tactics.</p>
